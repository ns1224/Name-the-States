# Introduction

This game is the project for the 25th Day of App Brewery's 100 Days of Python Code bootcamp. It is based on an example like this:

  https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/states
  
The user is prompted to enter states while there are still states to be guessed, or until the user inputs "Exit", to which the program responds by creating a .csv file with the names of the missing states.

# Tools

This project required Pandas, to read in the states data file, turtle to write to the screen when the user guessed correctly, and required os knowledge to write to a new file upon request.
